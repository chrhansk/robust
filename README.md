# A robust shortest path implementation

This code supplements the paper

[Hansknecht, Christoph, Alexander Richter, and Sebastian Stiller. "Fast robust shortest path computations."](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2018/9710/)

## Dependencies

This code depends on the following packages:

- [METIS](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/views/metis)
- [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest)
- [Intel TBB](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/)
- [Google Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)

You can install those packages on a Debian-based system (tested on Ubuntu focal, Debian bullseye) via

```shell
> apt update
> apt install build-essential cmake libboost-all-dev libmetis-dev libgtest-dev libtbb-dev libprotobuf-dev
```

## Building and testing

To build and test the code, run

```shell
> git clone git@github.com:chrhansk/robust.git
Cloning into 'robust'...
[...]
> cd robust
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ..
[...]
-- Build files have been written to: [...]
> make
[...]
[100%] Built target [...]
> make test
Running tests...
[...]
100% tests passed [...]
```

## Running benchmarks

This code includes several benchmarks, which are built
automatically. To execute all benchmarks and collect their respective
results, use the command

```shell
> make collect
```

This should produce several CSV files containing running times. Beware
to build the code in release mode to get accurate benchmarks results.
